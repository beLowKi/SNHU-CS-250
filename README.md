# Response Questions
- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories, ideally, represent specific user needs as interpreted by the Product Owner. Thus, as a developer, implementing them as software features is similar to addressing user needs. That's why it's important that the Product Owner creates accurate user stories.

- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to development is similar to Agile because I like programming inrementally: one feature at a time. It feels more natural when trying to make scaleable, modular code. Something I don't do that I'd like to incorporate more into my future development work is retrospectives. I don't make a habit of reviewing projects or features I've completed, but I'd like to. It's harder to benefit from incremental development when you don't deliberately adapt later cycles by what you learned in previous ones.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member is communicative and flexible. Good communication includes asking clarifying questions, making suggestions, documenting your work (code especially), and promptly responding to feedback. It's especially important for testers and developers because they often work together in Scrum-Agile. I think a good metric for developers is that if it takes at least as much work to understand your work as it did for you to make it, then it's poorly communicated. Flexibility is also important even outside of Agile for a lot of the same reasons as communication. It's easier to work with people who can be flexible--willing to adjust their schedule, methods, or way of thinking.
